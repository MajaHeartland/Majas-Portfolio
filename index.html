Built as part of NOW Music's promotional Christmas campaign, this project allowed fans to fill in a form and create their own personalized card. A download button let users save their creations to their computers. It was a fun and interactive way to engage with fans during the holiday season! 
              
              This was one of my very first projects, so even though it's very rough eround the edges, I really enjoy looking back at it so remind myself how far I've come as a developer &#128524;."
